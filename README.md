### Build es-next microservices on AWS Lambda!

# What is Atomable?
atomable is an es-next to cloud microservice framework. It can use either babel or traceur to make your latest code ready for deployment to AWS Lambda.

The cli provides you with commands to generate new microservices and deploy them so you are up and running in seconds. You won't have to provision any AWS resources yourself and atomable will take care of setting up your API Gateway, making deployments painless.

The framework also simplifies your API development by abstracting AWS Lambda and by offering features such as parameter validation, routing and error handling.

atomable is a cli and a runtime for building serverless microservices on the cloud. As of yet it supports AWS Lambda and nodejs.


# What can it do for me?
It can make you save loads of time. You won't have to configure your cloud or your build pipeline.

Out of the box we offer transpilers, eslint, webpack and a minifier. With those tools and the infrastructure of AWS, your code will be on the right track to automation, testing, security and scalability without any effort up-front.

atomable will also help you develop new features faster by reducing the boiler plate code that every API needs.
